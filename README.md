<h1> Stray Kids Maniac Tour </h1>
<p> This was my first concert ever, and a very memorable one. It was truly enjoyable, and made my love for this group grow even more. I went with my bestfriend and this is how we both started loving going to concerts, now we go at least twice a year. </p>

<h1> Enhypen Manifesto: Day 1 Tour </h1>
<p> This was my second concert which I also went with my best friend to. I had pretty good seats for this concert so I really enjoyed the whole performance. Enhypen is one of my favortie groups, so it eas great to see them on their first U.S. show ever. </p>
