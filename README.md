<h1> Stray Kids Maniac Tour 2022 </h1>
<p> This was my first concert ever, and a very memorable one. It was truly enjoyable, and made my love for this group grow even more. I went with my bestfriend and this is how we both started loving going to concerts, now we go at least twice a year. </p>

<h1> Enhypen Manifesto: Day 1 Tour 2022 </h1>
<p> This was my second concert which I also went with my best friend to. I had pretty good seats for this concert so I really enjoyed the whole performance. Enhypen is one of my favortie groups, so it was great to see them on their first U.S. show ever. </p>

<h1> Stray Kids Maniac Encore 2022 </h1>
<p> This was my second Stray Kids concert and I had really good seats. I was in floor Row 2, right in front of the stage. I was super excited since Stray Kids is my favorite group and I got to see them up close. I also went to this concert with my best friend. During soundcheck I played rock, paper, scissors with one of the members because I brought a sign with me. Overall, it was so much fun and I wish I could relive this experience. </p>

<h1> Lolapallooza Paris 2023 - Stray Kids </h1>
<p> For this concert, I happened to be in Paris during summer break when Stray Kids was supposed to perform at this festival. Since I'm a huge fan of them I decided to go, and I went with my dad. At first, I was a little nervous because we would be in a foreign country, but it was pretty easy to get around since most people spoke English. The day of the concert, I was in Spain but we were going to be back in Paris 2 hours before the concert began. We arrived at our hotel quickly and took off, making it just in time to see Stray Kids perform. There was a huge crowd and I was excited to be part of it. It was so much fun and I would definitely do this again.
