<h2> Stray Kids Maniac Tour 2022 </h2>
<p> This was my first concert ever, and a very memorable one. It was truly enjoyable, and made my love for this group grow even more. I went with my bestfriend and this was how we both fell in love with going to concerts. Now, we try to go atleast twice a year whenever our favs are in town. </p>

<h2> Enhypen Manifesto: Day 1 Tour 2022 </h2>
<p> This was my second concert and I also took my bestfriend with me. I had pretty good seats for this concert so I really enjoyed the whole performance. Enhypen is one of my favortie groups, so it was great to see them perform in the U.S for the first time. </p>

<h2> Stray Kids Maniac Encore 2023 </h2>
<p> This was my second Stray Kids concert and I had really really really good seats. I was in floor on Row 2, right in front of the stage. I was super excited since Stray Kids is my favorite group and I got to see them up close. I also went to this concert with my best friend. During soundcheck I played rock, paper, scissors with one of the members because I brought a sign with me which caught their attention. Overall, it was so much fun and I wish I could relive this experience. </p>

<h2> Lolapallooza Paris 2023 - Stray Kids </h2>
<p> For this concert, I happened to be in Paris during summer break, at the same time that Stray Kids was supposed to perform at this festival. Since I'm a huge fan of them I decided to go, and I went with my dad. At first, I was a little nervous because we would be in a foreign country, but it was pretty easy to get around since most people spoke English. The day of the concert, I was in Spain, but we were going back in Paris in order to be able to go to the concert. We arrived at our hotel an hour before the concert began and quickly and took off, making it just in time to see Stray Kids perform. There was a huge crowd; it was so much fun and I would definitely do this again.
